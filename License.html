<h2 id="section-i-preamble">Section I: PREAMBLE</h2>
<p>Multimodal generative models are being widely adopted and used, and have the potential to transform the way artists,
    among other individuals, conceive and benefit from AI or ML technologies as a tool for content creation.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the current and potential benefits that these artifacts can bring to society at large, there are also
    concerns about potential misuses of them, either due to their technical limitations or ethical considerations.</p>
<p>In short, this License strives for both the open and not commercial purpose: so, Pylar Documents, does not allow: use
    for commercial or endorse. When it comes to the open character, we took inspiration from open source but not to
    permit or grant of IP rights to anyone. Referring to the downstream responsible use, we added use-based restrictions
    &quot;Use Restrictions&quot; section.</p>
<p>In terms of publishing always must be for non commercial and endorse porpuse:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Pylar Documents.</li>
    <li>the in-process results of Pylar Documents.</li>
    <li>the end results of Pylar Documents.
        and always limited to scientific and research demonstrations via twitter with the &quot;@miguelgargallo&quot;
        &quot;#PylarAI&quot; tags or &quot;@miguelgargallo.es&quot; tag and description keyword on Instragam.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the same time, we strive to promote open and responsible research on generative models for art and science, both:
    research and science for not commercial or endorese content generation.</p>
<p>Downstream derivative versions of Pylar Documents could not be released. We believe in the intersection between open
    and responsible AI development; thus, this License aims to strike a balance between both in order to enable
    responsible open-science publishing results, in the field of AI and not commercial or endorse.
    This License governs the use of Pylar Documents and is informed by Pylar Documents card associated with Pylar
    Documents.</p>
<h2 id="section-ii-overview">Section II: OVERVIEW</h2>
<p>Pylar AI creative ML is a license designed to govern the use of multimodal generative models and related documents
    (referred to as &quot;Pylar Documents&quot; in this License). These models have the potential to transform the way
    artists and other individuals conceive and benefit from artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)
    technologies as a tool for content creation.</p>
<p>While there are many potential benefits to society from the use of these models, there are also concerns about
    potential misuses, whether due to technical limitations or ethical considerations. This License therefore strives to
    balance the open and non-commercial nature of Pylar Documents, while also promoting responsible research and use of
    generative models for art and science.</p>
