## Section I: OVERVIEW

Pylar AI creative ML is a license designed to govern the use of multimodal generative models and related documents (referred to as "Pylar Documents" in this License). These models have the potential to transform the way artists and other individuals conceive and benefit from artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies as a tool for content creation.

While there are many potential benefits to society from the use of these models, there are also concerns about potential misuses, whether due to technical limitations or ethical considerations. This License therefore strives to balance the open and non-commercial nature of Pylar Documents, while also promoting responsible research and use of generative models for art and science.

## Section II: PERMISSIONS AND LIMITATIONS

Under this License, the following permissions are granted for the use of Pylar Documents:

    Private use: Pylar Documents may be used for personal, non-commercial purposes.
    Science and research publications: Pylar Documents may be used in scientific and research publications, as long as they are not used for commercial or endorsement purposes.
    Non-commercial publications: Pylar Documents may be used in non-commercial publications, as long as they are not used for endorsement purposes.
    Modification for pull requests: Pylar Documents may be modified for the purpose of creating pull requests, as long as the modifications are made within the Official Sources (as defined in Section VIII) and are not used for endorsement purposes.

The following limitations apply to the use of Pylar Documents:

    Commercial use: Pylar Documents may not be used for commercial purposes.
    Endorsement: Pylar Documents may not be used for endorsement purposes.
    Liability: The creators and owners of Pylar Documents are not liable for any damages resulting from the use of Pylar Documents.
    Distribution: Pylar Documents may not be distributed without the written permission of the creators and owners.
    Warranty: Pylar Documents are provided "as is" without any warranty.
    Modification to endorse: Pylar Documents may not be modified for the purpose of endorsement.
    Modification for pull requests outside of Official Sources: Prohibited. This means that you are not allowed to modify the Pylar Documents or any Derivatives of the Pylar Documents for the purpose of making a pull request outside of the designated Official Sources, as defined in the License. This is in order to ensure that all modifications to the Pylar Documents are properly documented and can be easily tracked and traced by the Owners.
